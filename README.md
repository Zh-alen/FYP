README FILE

This is a file that describes the structure and the environmental requirements for this program

For these files, I use PyTorch from https://ifibertrans.sjtu.edu.cn/ to run a simulation.
The environmental requirements should be the same as the website of SJTU.
I added two files to explore the data and view them, so that we can directly see what the input and output are.

Next step: 
to find a dataset to run again using PyTorch
to run the same dataset using numpy
to run a Commplax project using the same data
to compare the performance
